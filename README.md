## Description

KKIJ Travels incorporates two apis from ticketmaster and GEO API to allow you to search for events happening within your selected city. Upon entering our webpage you will be presented with four different popular city options as a quick click for events if those satisify what you're inquiring on. If the popular city option doesn't meet your requirements then you can utilize the search bar which will show an autocomplete dropdown box that has bing maps api incorporated and will populate below the search bar, after entering the first couple of letters to your desired city and then those results will render to the page in a list format that you can then select by clicking on it to populate the events for the city within the state you're seeking information. Next, you will be able to see the events results on the page and if this event is something you would like to inquire on further you can click "Get Tickets" this will send you to the ticketmaster site in which you can see pricing, location and more. Addtiionally, local storage has been added to save the data from previous search results. Please see the visual section or click the site link to try it out yourself!
